# Checklist for Running a Digital Exam

(Last updated: March 28, 2023)

This document is created by Yen-Chia Hsu, when running the data science course for the Bachelor Information Science program.

A digital exam means that students take the exam using some software on the computer.
The exam is typically conducted in a physical room with computers.
This document explains what to do before, during, and after digital exams.
This document also assumes that the digital exam uses [ANS](http://ans.app/)
The target audience for this document include course coordinators and teaching staff members.

## Who to Contact

Below are two emails that are important in the communication of exam settings:
- The exam desk <tentamenbureau-fnwi@uva.nl>
- The digital test office <digitaletoets-fnwi@uva.nl>

Generally speaking, the exam desk deals with matters related to the physical room (e.g., computer settings, invigilators hiring), and the digital test office deals with issues related to the software that will be used during the exam (e.g., ANS).
In the following checklist, we refer to these emails using their names (i.e., the exam desk, or the digital test office).

## Long Before the Exam Date

For communications:
- [ ] Make an announcement on Canvas to explain what will be covered in the exam (e.g., the range of course materials), the type of questions (e.g., multiple-choice questions, open-ended questions, coding questions), and what software tools that they will (or can) use during the exam (e.g., ANS, Jupyter Notebook).
- [ ] If there are multiple partial exams, and the second (or any follow-up) exam will be harder than the first one, make an announcement on Canvas to remind students that the exam will be more difficult than the previous one.
- [ ] If there are multiple-choice questions and [guess correction](https://support.ans.app/hc/en-us/articles/360014340098-Guess-correction) will be enabled, communicate with the students about this using a Canvas announcement.
- [ ] Make an announcement on Canvas to emphasize that there is no Internet access during the exam.
- [ ] Communicate with the exam desk to hire invigilators (normally, 1 invigilator per 50 students). Typically, the exam desk will ask if hiring invigilators is necessary via email.

For exam materials:
- [ ] When designing the ANS questions, have a description at the end of the test to indicate that this is the end of the exam. The purpose is to improve exam clarity.

Optional:
- [ ] Provide a suggested study plan for the students to prepare exams (e.g., re-watch lecture recordings, review course slides, redo assignments, prepare one page cheatsheet, etc).
- [ ] When some students have conflicts in scheduling exams, one solution is to have the student take two (or multiple) exams together in one location. In this situation, ensure that the digital test office has communicated this well with the exam desk to allocate a desk for the student to stay longer. There is a chance that the people on site will be surprised by this due to the lack of communication.

## Just Before the Exam

For communication:
- [ ] Communicate with the exam desk about any required setting in the physical room. Special requests need to be done a couple of months ahead, for example, using a specific software during the exam. Usually, the exam desk will email the course coordinator for confirmation.
- [ ] Make an announcement on Canvas to remind students of the following information:
  - They must bring a valid ID (student ID card or other government-issued ID) to the exam location.
  - They are allowed to enter the exam room up to 30 minutes past the exam starting time.
  - They are not allowed to leave the exam room during the first 30 minutes and last 15 minutes of the normal exam schedule. The purpose of the rule is to prevent fraud (during the first 30 minutes) and disturbance (during the last 15 minutes).

For exam materials, software, and other information:
- [ ] Have the exam materials ready online on ANS and email them to the digital test office 7 days before the exam date. Ask the digital test office to schedule the exam time slots on ANS.
- [ ] Set a password on ANS so that students can start at the same time. The password setting can be found on Settings -> Accessibility -> Access.
- [ ] The exam desk will provide the attendance list by email upon request (usually, they will ask). Print 3 copies of the attendance list and bring them to the exam location. We need to give them to the invigilators.
- [ ] Ask the exam desk about the name of the invigilators so that they can be correctly identified as the invigilators on site.

For sanity checks:
- [ ] Check if the time slots that the exam team scheduled for the exam matches the listed exam time on [datanose](https://datanose.nl).
- [ ] Check the list of students with extra exam time, which will be provided by the exam desk by email. Then, make sure that on the attendance list, their name has a star-shaped symbol (\*) after it so that the invigilators know that these students have extra time during the exam. If there are missing star-shaped symbols, add them manually to the attendance list.
- [ ] The digital test office will schedule several time slots on ANS. Typically there are two of them. One for the standard exam schedule. And another one for students with extended time. Check if the students who have time extensions are actually in the time slot with extensions. If not, email the digital test office and ask them for help resolving the problem.

Optional:
- [ ] If this is the final exam, get the course evaluation form from the education desk. The evaluation form is provided by <opleidingsassistent-iw-science@uva.nl> via email (normally they will initialize the conversation about course evaluation).
- [ ] Bring the course evaluation form to the exam location with some extra pens.

## During the Exam

Be there at the exam location **at least 45 minutes early** before the exam starting time. Communicate the following to the invigilators:
- [ ] Have all the students with extra time sitting in the row that is as far away from the entrance as possible to prevent them from being disturbed.
- [ ] Explain when and how to check student ID. Typically, having the student ID card is sufficient to check if the ID number matches the one on the attendance list. It is better if students bring government-issued IDs.
- [ ] Give the student attendance list, and communicate that students do not need to sign on the sheet. Ask invigilators to just put a checkmark on the attendance list after checking the ID. In this way, we minimize disturbance to students.
- [ ] Explain the allowed/disallowed items for students to bring to the exam, such as a one-page cheatsheet.
- [ ] Let students enter the exam room about 10-15 minutes before the exam starts officially. In this way, the staff members on site can help students deal with login problems.

Other actions:
- [ ] Give students the password on ANS right before the exam starts using the microphone in the exam room.

Problem handling:
- [ ] If a student should have extra time but is not set correctly, email the digital test office and ask them for help resolving the problem. Or we can just log in to ANS and manually add students to the time slots with extra time (go to Taking -> Timeslots to select a time slot and add a student by name or student ID number).
- [ ] If a student cannot log in to the exam computer, ask the staff members on site to help the student log in to their computer.
- [ ] For any other problems that we are not sure how to solve, email the digital test office and the exam desk with an "urgent" tag in the email title. 
- [ ] If a student has a problem logging in to ANS, email the digital test office and ask them to create a temporary password for the student to log in. The password is only valid for a short time (roughly 15 minutes).
- [ ] If students can log in to ANS but do not see the exam, we can manually add them to the ANS system by searching their student ID. This can be done by clicking the timeslot in ANS and clicking on the "Add learner" button. But if the student ID number (or name) does not appear on the ANS system, email the digital test office to ask them to resolve the problem.
- [ ] The general rule is that we cannot allow students to enter the exam room after 30 minutes. However, there is a chance that students can take the exam after 30 minutes if they are very late, providing that nobody has left the room (which means no possibility of exchanging information). In this case, allow the student to do the test but communicate with the student that the exam can be invalid (which may need approval). Later, email the program coordinator to report the case and ask for approval.

Optional:
- [ ] If this is the final exam, distribute the course evaluation form during the exam to students, for example, by placing the form at each desk in the exam room.

## After the Exam

Grading related:
- [ ] First [export the grades from ANS](https://support.ans.app/hc/en-us/articles/360036410294-Export-results) into a CSV file, and then [import the grades to Canvas](https://canvas.uva.nl/courses/169/pages/using-the-gradebook?module_item_id=1237607#Import_Grades).
- [ ] Within 20 working days, release the grade on Canvas and tell students how they can inspect their grade by making an announcement on Canvas. There are several ways to do grade inspection, and some examples are listed below.
  - Grade inspection without supervision: schedule a time slot using ANS to open the exam for a time period that allows students to inspect their exam grades, questions, and answers online. This can be done by going to the ANS system and selecting Settings -> Publication -> Add timeslot. Communicate with the student how they can ask questions, for example, by scheduling a meeting with the course coordinator.
  - Grade inspection with supervision: email the program coordinator to ask for help reserving a physical room for grade inspection during a specific time. Students can come to the room to access the exam materials and grades, as well as ask questions during the scheduled time

## Other Notes

When in doubt, check the [UvA Teaching and Examination Regulations](https://student.uva.nl/onderwerpen/onderwijs-en-examenregelingen-oer) or ask the program director/coordinator.
