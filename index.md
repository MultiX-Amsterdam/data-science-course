## <a name="contact"></a>Contact

For questions about general lab matters, contact Yen-Chia Hsu, Nanne van Noord, or Marcel Worring.

For questions specifically about ICT, contact Dennis Koelma. Below are some examples:

- Need access to GPU clusters
- Need to order a new computer
- Need access to some specific software

For questions specifically about administrative matters, contact Petra Venema first. If she is out of office, contact the secretary office using their group email. Below are some examples:

- Want to reserve a meeting room
- Want to be on a specific institution mailing list

These people's email can be found by typing their names in the search bar after logging into [Microsoft Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/mail/) using the @uva.nl account. 

## <a name="communication"></a>Communication

We have a group mailing list and a Slack channel for general communication purposes. Below are some examples to use them:

- Share information of events (e.g., interesting talks, PhD events, summer school information, etc)
- Make important announcements
- Request something (e.g., filling out a form) from other people
- Share temporary files with other people (for files that are related to the lab and needed to be stored for a long time, please put the files on our Microsoft Teams channel)

For sharing upcoming events, we have a shared Microsoft Outlook calendar. In general, you can put events that are related to the lab or for a group of people on the calendar. Below are some example events to put on the calendar:

- Special lab events (e.g., social gathering, Xmas party)
- Thesis defense events for lab members
- Interesting talks that PhD students may be interested

For sharing files that are related to the entire lab (or many people), we have a Microsoft Teams channel. One benefit of sharing files in this way is that the storage space is very large, and we will know where the files are for the long term. This is for putting and sharing files that are related to the entire lab. For sharing files within a very small number of people (e.g., paper writing), it is still better to use your own way (e.g., via personal Google Drive). Below are some examples of usage:

- Share documents (e.g., pdf or docx files) with the entire group, such as administrative matters
- Share photos (e.g., those from social events) with the entire group
- Archive project related documents, such as research ethics reviewing documents or meeting notes

## <a name="lab-website"></a>Lab Website

Our lab website is hosted in [this repository](https://github.com/MultiX-Amsterdam/multix-amsterdam.github.io). Please contact Yen-Chia Hsu if you want to add your paper to the lab publication list, or if you want to add news (e.g., your paper is accepted at a conference) to the lab page.

## <a name="lab-meeting"></a>Lab Meeting

Our regular meeting time is Wednesday 14:00-15:00. Check our Slack channel for the meeting information (e.g., the virtural meeting link). If you want to join the meeting in person, check the room number on the Slack channel. Usually the meeting room is at the 3rd floor in LAB42.
