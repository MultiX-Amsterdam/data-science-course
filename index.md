## <a name="contact"></a>Contact

For questions about general lab matters, contact Yen-Chia Hsu, Nanne van Noord, or Marcel Worring.

For questions specifically about ICT, contact Dennis Koelma. Below are some examples:

- Need access to GPU clusters
- Need to order a new computer
- Need access to some specific software

For questions specifically about administrative matters, contact the IVI secretary office **using their group email** (secr-ii-science@uva.nl). Below are some examples:

- Want to reserve a meeting room
- Want to be on a specific institution mailing list
- Need something specific for your workplace

These people's email can be found by typing their names in the search bar after logging into [Microsoft Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/mail/) using the @uva.nl account.

## <a name="communication"></a>Communication

We have a group mailing list and a Slack channel for general communication purposes. Below are some examples to use them:

- Share information of events (e.g., interesting talks, PhD events, summer school information, etc)
- Make important announcements
- Request something (e.g., filling out a form) from other people
- Share temporary files with other people (for files that are related to the lab and needed to be stored for a long time, please put the files on our Microsoft Teams channel)

For sharing upcoming events, we have a shared Microsoft Outlook calendar. In general, you can put events that are related to the lab or for a group of people on the calendar. Below are some example events to put on the calendar:

- Special lab events (e.g., social gathering, Xmas party)
- Thesis defense events for lab members
- Interesting talks that PhD students may be interested

## <a name="lab-files"></a>Lab Files

For sharing files that are related to the entire lab (or many people), we have a Microsoft Teams channel. One benefit of sharing files in this way is that the storage space is very large, and we will know where the files are for the long term. This is for putting and sharing files that are related to the entire lab. For sharing files within a very small number of people (e.g., paper writing), it is still better to use your own way (e.g., via personal Google Drive). Below are some examples of usage:

- Share documents (e.g., pdf or docx files) with the entire group, such as administrative matters
- Share photos (e.g., those from social events) with the entire group
- Archive project related documents, such as research ethics reviewing documents or meeting notes

For sharing private files or data that may require version control, we have a [GitLab](https://uva-hva.gitlab.host/multix-amsterdam). Ask Yen-Chia Hsu if you want to have access. Below are some examples of usage:

- Archive teaching materials for a course

## <a name="lab-website"></a>Lab Website

Our lab website is hosted in [this repository](https://github.com/MultiX-Amsterdam/multix-amsterdam.github.io). Please contact Yen-Chia Hsu if you want to add your paper to the lab publication list, or if you want to add news (e.g., your paper is accepted at a conference) to the lab page.

## <a name="lab-meeting"></a>Lab Meeting

We have one regular lab meeting every week. The meeting frequency is reduced during summertime. Check our Slack channel for the meeting information (e.g., meeting time, meeting location, the virtual meeting link, etc). If you want to join the meeting in person, check the room number on the Slack channel. Usually, the meeting room is on the 3rd floor in LAB42.

## <a name="reserve-room"></a>Find a Meeting Room

From April 2023, it is now possible to sefl-reserve meeting rooms. To do this, you need to first create a [Microsoft Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/mail/) calendar event using your @uva.nl account. Then, you can specify the room that you want to reserve or use the room finder by clicking on the "Search for a room or location" box on the user interface when creating the calendar event.

Below is a table showing the room that people in IVI (i.e., the Informatics Institute) can reserve, as well as the capacity (number of people). To search for the room, enter (or copy/paste) the text in the "Room" column in the table below to the location search box on the user interface when creating the calendar event. The "Lab42" building means the address "Science Park 900", and the "904" building means the address "Science Park 904".

| Building | Room | Capacity |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Lab42 | ASP L3.03 | 6 |
| Lab42 | ASP L3.04 | 6 |
| Lab42 | ASP L3.05 | 6 |
| Lab42 | ASP L3.08 | 8 |
| Lab42 | ASP L3.11 | 6 |
| Lab42 | ASP L3.26 | 6 |
| Lab42 | ASP L3.33 | 25 |
| Lab42 | ASP L3.36 | 50 |
| 904 | ASP 107 F1.15 | 24 |
| 904 | ASP 107 F3.20 | 18 |
| 904 | ASP B1.25 | 24 |
| 904 | ASP B1.49C | 16 |
| 904 | ASP C3.163 | 21 |
| 904 | ASP C4.174 | 30 |

> Note: If a meeting is canceled, please make sure that you also cancel the meeting event on the calendar to make the room available to other people.

Besides the above-listed rooms that require reservations, you can also use the following rooms without booking. Just walk in to use the room if no one is using it. You may need to use your UvA badge to unlock the room. Typically these are small meeting rooms for at most 6 people.

- Lab42 L4.02
- Lab42 L4.09
- Lab42 L4.26
- Lab42 L4.48
- Lab42 L4.51
- Lab42 L5.18
- Lab42 L5.44
- Lab42 L5.49
- Lab42 L5.54
- Lab42 L5.64
- Lab42 L6.05

When in doubt, contact the IVI secretary office by email.
